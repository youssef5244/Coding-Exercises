## Dynamic Styling with Inline Styles
```
Your task is to help out a colleague and style a h1 element dynamically (with inline styles) depending on which button was pressed.
If the "Yes" button is pressed, the h1 element should receive color: "green" as an inline style. If the "No" button is pressed,
color: "red" should be applied.
Initially, when no button has been clicked yet, the color should be set to "white".
Important: You must use these specific colors ("green", "red", "white") - don't use any hex code or slight variations of these colors!
In addition, this Udemy exercise workspace does not support the direct usage of React Hooks - instead, import React from 'react' and
then use Hooks like this: React.useState().
