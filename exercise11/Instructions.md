# Dynamic Styling
```
Your task is to dynamically apply a CSS class (active) to the <p>Style me</p> element in the provided React app.
The class should be applied when the <button> is clicked for the first time.
Important: Use React.useState() instead of just useState() as the latter can cause problems in this Udemy code environment.
