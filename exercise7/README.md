# Reacting to Events
Your task is to work on a "User Login" component that has already been prepared by a colleague.

The goal is to update the data stored in the already existing user object with some dummy data once the "Login" button in the App component is pressed.

The email and password properties in the user object should be set to any non-empty string values of your choice. The loggedIn field should be set to true.

Important: You don't have to fetch the values entered into the <input> fields - you can simply ignore those fields for now. You'll learn how to listen to keystrokes and get user input later in the course.

# Original Code:
```
// Your goal is to change the email, password and loggedIn values when the button in the App component is pressed
// Change them to any values of your choice (except loggedIn => that should be changed to true)
// You DON'T need to fetch the values entered into the <input /> fields
// You'll learn about that later in the course - for the moment, those fields are just there to look good :-)
export const user = {
  email: '',
  password: '',
  loggedIn: false,
};

// Please note: The login does not actually work!
// This exercise is just about practicing event handling
// You'll learn how to add user authentication to React apps later in the course!
function App() {
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <h1>User Login</h1>
      <p>
        <label>Email</label>
        {/* You don't need to do anything with those inputs! You'll learn how to handle user input later */}
        <input type="email" />
      </p>

      <p>
        <label>Password</label>
        {/* You don't need to do anything with those inputs! You'll learn how to handle user input later */}
        <input type="password" />
      </p>

      <p id="actions">
        <button>Login</button>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
