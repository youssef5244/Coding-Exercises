## Creating & Using Context
```
Your task is to add a "theming" feature to a demo app you're given by a colleague. This "theming" feature should be
implemented with help of React's Context API.
Your main goal is to ensure that the "Toggle Theme" button in the Header component triggers a (to-be-added)
toggleTheme() function exposed through context.
The context value should be dynamic and managed inside the ThemeContextProvider.js file. The current theme mode should
be managed as a value that's either  'light' or 'dark' and exposed via a theme property on the overall context object.
The context object should also expose the above-mentioned toggleTheme() method that changes the theme property's value 
('light' <-> 'dark').
The Header component needs access to the context to call the toggleTheme() method, the Page component will need access
to apply a the CSS class 'light' (for theme === 'light') or the class 'dark' (theme === 'dark') to the <div id="app">.

Important: In this Udemy exercise workspace, any React Hooks (and other React functions!) must be accessed directly
on the imported React object (import React from 'react') - for example: React.useState().
