## Using useReducer()
```
Your task is to build a basic counter app that uses React's useReducer() Hook for state management - not the 
useState() Hook!
To achieve this goal, you should enhance the already existing counterReducer function that can be found right
next to the App component (don't remove the export keyword!).
In addition, inside the App component, the useReducer Hook should be used with that reducer function to manage
the counter state.
The three <button> elements should be "connected" to the reducer-managed state (i.e., they should trigger state
changes), the <p id="counter"> element should output the count value.
Important: The state managed with help of the reducer must be an object of the following shape:
{
  count: 0; // of course, 0 is not static but changes as the different <button>s are clicked
} 
When dispatching actions, you should make sure that every action is an object that has a type property (it must 
be named type - other names will make the automatic checks fail!) that contains either 'INCREMENT', 'DECREMENT'
or 'RESET' as a value!

Important: In this Udemy exercise workspace, any React Hooks must be accessed directly on the imported React
object (import React from 'react') - for example: React.useState().
```
## Original Code
```
export function counterReducer() {}

function App() {
  return (
    <div id="app">
      <h1>The (Final?) Counter</h1>
      <p id="actions">
        <button>Increment</button>
        <button>Decrement</button>
        <button>Reset</button>
      </p>
      <p id="counter"></p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
