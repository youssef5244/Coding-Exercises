 ## Exercise: Dynamic Styles
 ```
Your task is to dynamically apply a style (color: red) to the <p>Style me</p> element in the provided React app.
The style should be applied as an inline style (i.e., via the style attribute / prop) when the <button> is clicked
for the first time. Once the button is clicked again, the styling should switch back to color: white, which should
also be the initial style.
Make sure that the button toggles between these two styles (color: white <=> color: red).
Important: Use React.useState() instead of just useState() as the latter can cause problems in this Udemy code environment.
```
## Original Code
```
import React from 'react';

// don't change the Component name "App"
export default function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Style me!</p>
            <button>Toggle style</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```
